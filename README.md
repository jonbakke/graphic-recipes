# Graphic Recipes

These recipes present the cooking process in a graphic format that is intended to convey the use of ingredients, preparation methods, and overall creative process with layout as much as with text.

Recipes are often presented as walls of text (or, slightly better, as fences with a bulleted list or two). The inexperienced cook might look at a high quality recipe the same way that a new Linux user might look at their first man page. I suspect that a different presentation might help make cooking more accessible to a wider audience.

These designs are my first sketches. I hope to automate much of this process to make these recipes easy to create, modify, and share.
